        Over these past few weeks I have learned some of the very basic principles of coding. I am transitioning out of the Navy and am figuring out what I might like to do as a civilian. I have enjoyed the experience so far and I would like the opportunity to expand
        on this knowledge and be able to learn in an immersive environment with other motivated individuals.
